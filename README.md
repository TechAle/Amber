Amber client- The awesome custom base writen from 0 anarchy utlity mod made by the one and only Techale. Attempting to learn kotlin as he progresses with this utility mod. What unknown bugs will appear? How will he cope when the game crashes? Will he finish it?
I'd like to point out that while this will be writen from scratch inspairation will likely be used from other utlity mods which look or preform the best, that being said all credit will be given to the proper owners.
