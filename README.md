# Amber Client
## What is this?
This is an client developed by me in kotlin.<br>
I started this because i wanted to learn new things but, the more i coded this and the more bored i become and the less i felt i was learning.<br>
And now, since i complitely left minecraft anarchy developement, i find no reasons why on releasing this on the public.<br>
## Features
Nothing, i started this with 0 (i mean, i started this with a template (tempest) but, then i rewrote everything)<br>
It doesnt even have a gui, it just has renderUtils2d, a command system and uh, i think nothing else except some particles.<br>
No reasons on using this
## Credits
* Tempest since i used it as a start 
* Lambda for the rounded render
